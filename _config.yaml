description: "Once apon a time I fancied myself a writer, a journalist, and even a starving artist. During those days I created an archive of fictional stories. This is mostly a collection of those, with maybe a post added from time to time. Many of my stories are unfinished, so if you'd like to give them a good ending, please do. I look forward to seeing them improved."
