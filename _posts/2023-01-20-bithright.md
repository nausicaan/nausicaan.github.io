On the morning of January 10, 1903, in the middle of the worst winter on record, a break in the storm let a blue sky wash over a small house. The house burned out of control on its lonely acre of Saskatchewan farmland. In the distance a small figure ran heavily through the deep snow.

Daniel stopped and turned around. The fire reflected in his swollen eyes, and down his cheek, captured in a teardrop. He stood knee deep in the snows cold grip, watching as the flames consumed his home, his family. He could hear his mother's screams melting together with the crackling flames.

&ldquo;Daniel!&rdquo; A scream, a crash, then silence.

He didn't move.

Daniel was twelve, but only for two months. He twitched and shivered as the old farmhouse collapsed. His dark hair protruded slightly from the wool hat he'd worn to bed. It wasn't meant to be a nightcap, but he liked the way it kept his head warm. Houses had a tendency to draft when they got older, and you haven't felt a draft until you've felt one on the prairies in January.

But it wasn't the cold that Daniel felt now, the heat pushed against him like waves crashing a shore. It completely shielded his bare hands and bootless feet from the chill of the morning air. Other than that he was fully dressed &mdash; trousers, wool shirt, two pairs of socks. You couldn't get through a winter's night any other way.

Daniel was in a state of shock. He couldn't remember how he'd gotten outside, or how the fire had started. He just couldn't seem to do anything. He watched as the fire took everything. Everything he was and everything he knew was in that house. It was the shock rather than the cold that had frozen him. For a while he stood, as if in a trance &mdash; watching &mdash; until a snowflake fell on his blank face. His stare broken by its touch, reality rushed in. Daniel wiped the snowflake from his face. The cloudless blue serenity that hung above him only moments before had filled with the signs of an angry storm. He looked at the snowflake melting in his hand, and knew this was only the first of ten thousand more.

He started running again.

Within half an hour the storms screaming blackness had blurred all points of perspective. It didn't really matter, even if that blue sky had remained, Daniel would have been lost. The blinding fury of the storm hadn't made the countryside beyond his home foreign to him, his own inexperience had. In the dozen years since his birth in that doomed homestead, he had never left it. A mile in any direction was as far as he had ever ventured. Now he was farther from home than he had ever been, and he was alone.

Completely alone.

He kept running, but exhaustion slowed his pace. He was suffering from frostbite; it had taken his senses, and was threatening all his extremities. There was no clarity in his mind, even as much clarity as a twelve-year-old can have. It held only emotion, and in the circus of emotion, fear dominated. Fear is a complex emotion, it can help and it can hinder, but in either case it is often single-minded. Concerned only with survival and self-preservation. Such was the case today. It conveyed only one thought to Daniel, made only one demand.

RUN!

The frozen numbness that overcame him before had turned to pain. Like ice, with each step he felt like he was about to shatter. At that moment, through the wall of snow a light appeared. Daniel stopped. He wiped his eyes clumsily with his frozen hands, looked, and wiped them again.

A light &mdash; it really was a light, he told himself. This was no hallucination or mirage, it was real. He ran, stumbling, falling, but running. *Was this heaven? Had he left his body? Was he a spirit? Had he succumb to the bitter cold and lay deep in a snowy grave?* In his present state of mind he didn't care. To him the light meant only one thing, an end to the unbearable pain surging through him. If only he could make it &mdash; if only&hellip;

Blackness gave way to light. Daniel opened his eyes slowly. He didn't know where he was or how much time had passed since he collapsed. The last thing he remembered was running towards the light, and hoping that light was his salvation. Praying for an end to his misery.

But nothing had ended. The pain certainly hadn't ended. He hadn't died; the heaven he knew wasn't filled with suffering. A dark thought entered his mind. *What if this wasn't life, and it wasn't heaven? What if this was something far worse?* A place whose name he couldn't even think. What if what he had done back at his home, the part he couldn't remember, had condemned him? It was just as his mother had told him, he was surrounded by heat, his frozen body now burned from within. His head was full of screams, just as she had said it would be. It was all he could hear. He tried to focus on something, anything, but he couldn't. The light was too bright; it hurt his eyes. He tried to move but something was holding him back.

*Then he tried to scream.*

He could do that well enough, so he kept screaming. The pain was too much to bear, screaming didn't really help, but it was all he could do. He wailed and cried, begged for mercy, and asked the lord for salvation. He exhausted himself screaming but didn't stop. Until a shadow crawled across his closed eyes. The light, which until this point had held him captive, was gone. He pushed aside his fear and forced his eyelids to open. The little light there was wasn't painful, he endured it well. It was the image beyond that frightened him. As his disorientation passed, his eyes began to focus. He expected to see the devil himself. What he finally saw startled him even more.

A face. The face of a woman. She was old, but beautiful. He could see her long silver hair framing her smiling countenance. The light surrounded her; she looked like an angel, which lifted his spirits immeasurably.

&ldquo;Hush now child, all that cater&ndash;walling ain't gonna do you no good.&rdquo; Her voice was soft and soothing. While she spoke he almost forgot about the pain. &ldquo;And here we was worried you'd never come 'round.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Daniel asked hoarsely. It took most of his strength to speak.

&ldquo;My Christian name is Rosalyn, but everyone calls me Rose. You might as well do the same.&rdquo; Her tone brought comfort. &ldquo;You rest now, we'll check on you later.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&hellip; can't move.&rdquo; He whispered.

She looked down at the torn strips of bed sheets wrapped around Daniel's limbs. &ldquo;I had to tie your hands 'n feet.&rdquo; Her eyes showed deep concern. &ldquo;You were lashin' bout somethin' fierce.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I'm alright now, could you&hellip; please?&rdquo; he pleaded weakly.

&ldquo;I s'pose it's safe, you bein' awake and all.&rdquo;

Rose left for a moment, returning with a cup. Small pockets of steam escaped into the air as she held it carefully in front of her. She pulled a small stool from out of Daniel's sight and sat down. Then she blew softly at the rising steam, shooing it away like she might a squirrel with a broom. Her creased lips and wrinkled cheeks working smoothly together.

&ldquo;Drink this, it'll help you sleep.&rdquo;

He drank.

It was warm, but not hot, just as she had most likely intended, he thought. After he took his last sip, Rose set the cup aside and smiled warmly at him. Just as she had said, within moments he felt sleepy. For the moment Daniel was content, his anguished eased. The screams were silent. Daniel drifted off to sleep.
Then it began &mdash; the dreams &mdash; the memories&hellip; flooding back into his subconscious. The fire burning out of control. He had escaped, but how? His memory was blurred; he couldn't remember anything before the fire.

For the next two days he lay in bed, his wounds severe. Bandages covered his hands and feet; they had swollen to three times their original size. Despite this, his strength grew with each new 	sunrise. Soon he could sit up; he even laughed on one occasion. But with each sunset the dreams would return. Always  the same, he was running for his life &mdash; from something, but he couldn't remember what. All he remembered was the fear, incredible, overpowering fear forcing him to run. Making it impossible for him to go back, save his mother, no matter how much he wanted to. Behind him clouds of black smoke billowed, turning day into night. He heard her die; it was a sound no one should ever have to hear.

He woke up screaming.

Rose burst in and knelt beside the bed. Daniel was sitting upright, trembling. She put an arm around him and began to rock back and forth, as if consoling an infant.
&ldquo;Can't move, can't help&hellip; can't help.&rdquo; He repeated.

&ldquo;It's alright,&rdquo; she stroked his hair softly, &ldquo;it was only a dream.&rdquo;

&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;couldn't help her, wouldn't let me&hellip;&rdquo; His voice trailed off.

Rose stayed with him for a long time. He talked in his sleep for hours.

&ldquo;Couldn't help her, should've helped her&hellip;&rdquo;

The next day Daniel was on the road to recovery. Frostbite, however, is unforgiving. He had lost four toes, and he still couldn't move his fingers, which had recovered to twice their normal size. He also had extensive scarring on his nose and ears. Despite, or perhaps because of the tragedy, Daniel and Rose became fast friends. Based primarily on mutual need, Daniel needed a mother, and Rose needed someone to mother.

Rose spent all of her time with Daniel, passing the hours with stories. He enjoyed the time they spent together; even though sometimes she would forget he was there and start talking to the *others*. Years of lonely solitude had turned Rose into quite an eccentric. Daniel didn't mind, he called them Rose's ghosts. He listened to her talk with them until he fell asleep. He imagined the life she led through her stories. It sounded wonderful. Glamorous society parties in Montreal. The marketplace, the cobblestone streets, it all sounded too good to be real. *But if it were real, why would anyone ever leave?* Real or not, it sounded like a great thing to dream about, far better than the dreams he did have.

Rose stopped talking; she looked at him and smiled. &ldquo;Enough stories, it's time for you to rest.&rdquo;

They spent most of the next day talking. The storm was still churning; two feet had fallen since the storm began. Rose did most of the talking, and Daniel listened intently. Her voice was heavenly and the subject was riveting. It filled his head with thoughts of life in the big city. The thought of leaving this desolate wasteland appealed to him very much. The harder he listened, the easier it was to block out his emotions. He didn't want to let those feelings in.
Later that evening, Rose left him alone for what seemed an eternity. He was frightened of being alone. He was afraid she was never coming back. He needed her voice to stop the pain, the remorse. The door opened, Rose was carrying a pair of crude looking canes.

&ldquo;What d'you think? I made them myself.&rdquo;

He lay still, his mouth gapping. He didn't know what to say.

&ldquo;They'll help you walk. If you don't start walking soon your legs'll get weak.&rdquo;

He had been with Rose for four days, and still had seen nothing but one room. It was enormous and rich looking by his standards, but compared to his home anything looked rich, he would soon discover. Though nervous about putting weight on his ugly, tender feet, he was excited at the prospect of seeing the rest of the house. If nothing else, he thought, this was his chance to explore.

The hallway was notably less grand than the room he'd spent the last four days in. Nonetheless it was good to walk again; Daniel knew it, even if his aching feet did not. At one end of the hall was a staircase leading down to the main floor. That excited him, he had never been in a house with *two* floors! As he hobbled his way up and down the hall &mdash; very slowly &mdash; he ran his hand along the railing for support. Periodically peering over at the sitting room below. *This was a mansion! How did an old lady, even a nice one like Rose, ever get a house like this?*

There were three doors, Rose's room, his room, and a closed door, in that order. *What was in there?* He had gone by it several times now, his curiosity growing with each passing. When Rose was satisfied he could continue on his own, she left to attend to some chores. Without her eyes to keep him focused, the curiosity became too much for him. He tried the knob &mdash; it worked. The room was dark, but light from the hallway cut a path around him, revealing a number of large wooden chests. Daniel didn't bother choosing which one to open, he just went for the closest one. There were no locks on any of them, and he soon found out why. They were full of clothes, medals, pictures, and the usual collection of old throw&ndash;aways. He was disappointed, he had expected to find something&hellip; exciting, even glamorous. All he found was an old woman's keepsakes and not very good ones at that.

He had almost decided to stop looking and go back to walking the halls when at the bottom he spotted a small box. It was made of a hard wood Daniel didn't recognize, and it too wasn't locked. A tarnished bronze plate with the initials J.D. engraved into it was fastened to the lid. He opened it slowly, trying to savor the moment. *Finally something exciting!* He didn't want to rush the experience. As the lid came up, the contents caught the light from the hall and reflected it back to him. He smiled, the light didn't hurt his eyes anymore, and the wait was worth it. Inside that darkened wood box, glinting from the light was a silver polished, pearl handled revolver. Daniel ran his bandaged fingers across it gently, as much for his sake as the revolvers. Its beauty mesmerized him, so much so that when the door creaked and Rose stepped in, he didn't even notice.

&ldquo;Beautiful&hellip; isn't it?&rdquo;

Daniel jumped at the sound of Rose's voice. He nearly fell off his supports, his feet stung.

&ldquo;It was my Jonathan's, he won it in a poker game. He got the box made special.&rdquo; She knelt beside Daniel, and admired the gun with him. &ldquo;The man he won it from had just bought it new, he gave it to Jonathan to cover his stake.&rdquo; She ran her fingers across the barrel. &ldquo;It's never even been fired.&rdquo;

Rose put the gun back in the crate and left Daniel to pace while she prepared dinner. During the meal, Rose brought up the subject both had been avoiding since he arrived. Daniel resisted at first, but Rose's persistence and charm won out in the end.

He told her everything he remembered.

&ldquo;The truth,&rdquo; she stressed softly, &ldquo;is the only thing that can end the pain you still feel &mdash; in here.&rdquo; She laid her open palm softly over his heart. &ldquo;You'll never be able to live with yourself 'til you know what happened that night.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I want to know, really I do&hellip; but how?&rdquo; he begged, his eyes glossy with waiting tears.

&ldquo;The dreams, it's the only way.&rdquo;

The dreams! *How could she even mention them?* He was terrified to explore his nightmares. Everything was buried so deep. The pain and fear, he had finally pushed them far enough away, how could he bring them back again? And what would he find if he did? *What if he had done it &mdash; what if he had killed her?* Burned the house down and killed his own mother. *What would Rose think of him then?* He desperately needed her friendship. He had known her only four days, but he knew he couldn't survive without her.

But he also knew she was right, he wouldn't be able to live with himself until he faced the truth about the fire.

Daniel lay on the bed, his eyes wide open and his body tense. For over an hour he was perfectly still, and desperately awake. Finally his resistance wore down, his body relaxed and his mind drifted off into the realm of dreams.

As had happened every night before, he found himself back there &mdash; back *home*. And just as before he was running, breathing deeply the cold air, which was heavy with the smell of burnt cinder and ash. Then he stopped and turned to face the house &mdash; again. But this time he started back. He had to force every step, he looked down at his feet, no boots, only socks. He looked back at the house and it was different, there was no fire. The house stood just as it always had, small, weathered, but strong. And there were voices, loud, excited voices coming from inside. He entered the house, and though he could feel a chill all around him, his heart beat so fast he was flushed.

As he crossed the threshold of front door, the fear returned. He knew those voices coming from the room and the end of the hall. It was his mother and father. They were fighting &mdash; they were always fighting, he remembered now. Daniel found the door slightly open; he pushed it the rest of the way. His mother was on the floor, screaming, begging &mdash; her arms held weakly in front of her. His father, Karl, stood above her, his powerful hands dropping like bombs. Daniel could see he was killing her.

&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;

Karl turned his head, and stared down Daniel. &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; He roared.

Daniel twitched. Sweat was pouring off him, and falling into his eyes, blurring his vision. If it were possible to die from fright, he would have. He wanted to bolt, more than anything, in fact, but something wouldn't let him.

&ldquo;Leave her alone!&rdquo; He screamed, his voice cracking and his body shaking.

Karl lumbered towards Daniel, his six&ndash;foot&ndash;three frame more menacing than anything Daniel had seen before. Now he ran. Karl's heavy footsteps close behind. He had no plan. *What the hell was he doing?* All he knew was he had to get him away from her. He couldn't let him hurt her anymore.
Daniel's breathing was quick and shallow, but panic had turned his legs to rubber, he tripped over his own feet and fell hard on the dirt floor. There he lay stunned until he felt the grip of a giant tighten around his neck. Karl tossed him across the room with little more than a grunt. He landed near the kitchen table.
&ldquo;I told you to get out!&rdquo; He barked. &ldquo;Now it's too late!&rdquo; His steps fell like a death march. &ldquo;I should have killed you the day you were born.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Why do you hate me?&rdquo; he cried, tears dropping like balls of water. &ldquo;You're my father!&rdquo; Daniel was bleeding from his temple, and his stomach was convulsing. Disorientation immobilized his senses.

Karl laughed sadistically. &ldquo;I'm not your father!&rdquo;

Karl's words were torturing Daniel. Why would he say these things? How can a father hate his own son?

&ldquo;You are my father!&rdquo; He wailed, still unable to pick himself up off the floor. &ldquo;You are!&rdquo;

Daniel instinctively tried to flee. He crawled backward like an invalid separated from his wheelchair, his legs dragging lifelessly. Then he reached the end of the line. With his back to the wall, and Karl approaching fast, he forced his legs to work, and fumbled to his feet. Karl charged. In desperation Daniel looked around for something, anything, to defend himself with. There was nothing &mdash; but the coal oil lamp. He grabbed it, by this time Karl was nearly on top of him. Karl lunged at him; there was no time to think, only to react. Daniel flung the lamp and turned away. He heard it explode, and he heard a scream, a deep cry of pain. He looked back and saw Karl, stumbling, flames searing his face.

Children of the flame spread throughout the room, igniting a set of nearby curtains. The spreading fire had made the room hot. Daniel was sweating worse than before, but it was fear that was making him sweat.

The smell of coal oil and burning flesh was making him sick. Karl waved his hands frantically, his face still burning. He made a grab for Daniel, but missed. Daniel ducked another try and ran for the door. Then he heard screaming. He stopped.

*Oh God*, he thought, *not the screams*.

He jumped up, looked around, he was in bed. He was awake, or was he? The screaming hadn't stopped. It was louder, worse than before.

Rose!

He ran gingerly to her room, his feet still very sore. He peered past the half&ndash;open door. Then he stopped breathing. Karl's naked, grotesquely burned back filled nearly his entire field of vision. His long, lean arms savagely beating Rose as she lay helplessly on the floor. It was just like the memory of his mother.

And it wasn't a dream.

How could he be alive? He couldn't have survived the fire &mdash; and the storm. But he had survived, somehow. Some evil had kept him alive&hellip; but why? And what about his mother, was she alive too? Only Karl knew the answers.

He was about to burst in when suddenly his fears betrayed him. *What am I going to do? I can't fight him, he's too strong&hellip;*
Then a memory purged him. *&ldquo;It was my Jonathan's, he won it in a poker game&hellip;&rdquo;*

The gun!

He hobbled to the room, grabbing a lit candle on the way. He rummaged through the chest &mdash; it's not here! &mdash; he panicked, throwing everything from the chest. A lifetime of Rose's memories strewn carelessly in only seconds.

A glimmer caught his eye, a metallic reflection from his candle. He touched the cold metal plate and knew he'd hit pay dirt.

&ldquo;Where is he Rose? Where's the boy?&rdquo; he slapped her hard with the back of his hand.

&ldquo;You can't have him Karl.&rdquo; She spat defiantly. &ldquo;You can't keep me away any longer. He's my grandson!&rdquo;

Daniel kicked open the door, and grimaced. Karl stopped pummeling Rose, and whirled around to face his *son*. Daniel stood firm, a look of determination masking the intense terror he really felt. Karl looked at the gun and laughed.

&ldquo;Are you prepared to use that thing?&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;It's a serious thing when a man brings a gun to a fist fight. Are you trying to be a man&hellip; *BOY?*&rdquo;

Karl moved towards Daniel. &ldquo;You'd better shoot me boy, 'cause if not, I *will* kill you.&rdquo;

Daniel's blood boiled. He pulled the trigger, his bloated hands swelling with pain.

Nothing happened.

He pulled it again, and again, still nothing. He kept pulling the trigger, clinging to the hope it would fire. Karl laughed and yanked the gun from Daniel's fragile fingers. Karl's free hand went around the young boy's neck. He lifted him to eye level, which for Daniel was about two feet off the ground. Daniel could feel Karl's fiery breath on his face as his torched, twisted fingers squeezed the life from him, but worse he could smell it. His face was dark, cheek bones protruded through charred skin.

&ldquo;Before you go to shoot somebody, it's best to have bullets in your gun.&rdquo; He smiled a wicked smile and tossed the gun aside. His rotten, stained teeth barely lighter than his blackened skin. &ldquo;Your real father made the same mistake, then I cut his heart out.&rdquo;

Daniel couldn't breathe; the lack of oxygen was clouding his judgement. He reacted instinctively using both feet to kick Karl in the groin. He was still weak from his injuries, but it was enough to bring the big man down.

He didn't stay down for long. Before Daniel's windpipe had opened enough to allow him a breath, Karl was on his feet. Daniel looked into his eyes; they carried a rage he had never seen before. It burned in him like the flesh on his face. His scaled knuckles cracked under the tension of a hard fist.

Daniel couldn't fight him, he couldn't even stand. His clothes were soaked with sweat and urine. Maybe if he let Karl kill him he would leave Rose alone, let her live.

No.

Karl would kill her, and he would do it slowly, so that she suffered. He had to stop him somehow, even if it meant his own death. He just couldn't let Rose die.

Daniel got to his knees and prepared to fight, knowing it was hopeless. This futile show of resistance amused Karl.

&ldquo;You've got guts boy, I'll give you that. Your sissy father begged for his life at the end.&rdquo; His fuming eyes had turned cold. &ldquo;But it makes no nevermind, I'm still gonna kill you.&rdquo;

Daniel pushed himself harder than he knew he could, and stood aching on both feet. He wanted to runaway, but most of all he wanted it to just end. He may not have been a man, but at least he could meet death like one.

Karl was smiling. Though full of hate, he relished the fact that Daniel was trying to fight back. It would make killing him all the more enjoyable. Daniel couldn't see Rose, or the rest of the room, Karl's body had totally eclipsed his view. His eyes closed instinctively, he just couldn't watch his own death.

Then he heard a loud snap, followed quickly by five others. He covered his ears after the first, and still his eyes were closed. A thud, like a sack of wet sand hitting the floor shook the room, but still he could not open his eyes. Then he felt a hand on him. He lurched trying to get away.

&ldquo;Daniel! It's me. It's Rose.&rdquo; She ran her slender fingers though his wet hair. &ldquo;Open your eyes, it's alright now.&rdquo;
He did as she said. He trusted her &mdash; his grandmother. If she said it was all right, he believed her.

He looked past her to the still body of Karl, six smoky holes in his back gorging with blood. &ldquo;You shot him, but the gun was&mdash;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I keep the bullets under the bed, always have.&rdquo;

The remains of Daniel's home were buried under three feet of snow, but he needed to know the truth. Maybe they were under the snow, waiting for him. Karl had survived, they could too. Rose helped as much as she could. They dug for hours, but found only wet ash and pieces of wood half digested by fire. They hadn't survived, maybe he'd always known, maybe he didn't want to know.

His heart sank, he collapsed &mdash; crying. He couldn't fight it anymore, all the emotions he had fought to suppress could not be denied any longer. Rose stood by, she could do nothing. Or maybe she could.

&ldquo;Let's go home.&rdquo; She said. &ldquo;I want to tell you about your father&hellip; your real father.&rdquo;

The remaining months of the winter went by slowly, as winter months do. In the spring Daniel and Rose packed their things and headed east, to Montreal.
